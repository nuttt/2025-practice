# Gemini Project Memory

This file stores project-specific information, conventions, and user preferences that Gemini should remember across sessions.

## Project Rules & Conventions

- **Project Type:** LeetCode practice.
- **My Role:** Act as a code reviewer and assistant. My primary tasks are to answer questions, review code, and suggest improvements.
- **Code Modification:** Do not create or modify code unless explicitly instructed by the user.
- **Solution Spoilers:** Do not provide the final solution to a problem unless explicitly asked.
- **Git Commits:** Use the conventional commit pattern when creating commit messages.
